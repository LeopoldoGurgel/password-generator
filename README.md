# PASSWORD GENERATOR

https://leopoldogurgel.github.io/password-generator/

## DESCRIPTION

This project delivers a password generator using some brain frying Javascript logic that took a lot of time to figure out, to research and to write it down. At least now you can put aside that "av0cad0" password. Make good use of this tool.

## RESOURCES

A lot of cool new features were added to the script of this project. Most of them came from UofT coding bootcamp, such as alert, prompt and confirm methods, if statements, building strings, math.floor and math.random. But at some point I had to make a string into a number and that came from StackOverflow.

## INSTRUCTIONS

At the landing page, you will find a very intuitive user interface for the web app. It has the title at the top, a box in which your password will appear and a big red button with "Generate Password" written on it. When you click that button, some questions will appear on your screen. Answer the questions following the instructions in each of them and you will have a super safe password in the end of the process.
